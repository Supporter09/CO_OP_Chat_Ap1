## Demo

You can test this app out live here: https://naughty-bhabha-908faa.netlify.com?room=test


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need to create an Okta developer account (which
is free): https://developer.okta.com/signup/

You'll also need to create an Okta Application of the SPA type, define your
redirect URIs, and set your trusted origins.

You'll then need to modify the `src/static/js/auth.js` file to include your own
Okta values.
